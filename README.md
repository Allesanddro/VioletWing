# Overview

VioletWing is an automated tool designed for Counter-Strike 2 that enhances gameplay with features like precise aiming, visual overlays, and movement automation. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy configuration.

## Features

- **TriggerBot**:
  - Automatically fires when an enemy is under your crosshair.
  - Configurable trigger key (e.g., `x`, `c`, `mouse4`, `mouse5`) via GUI or `config.json`.
  - Toggle mode for single-key activation.
  - Adjustable delays (`ShotDelayMin`, `ShotDelayMax`, `PostShotDelay`) for natural shooting.
  - Option to attack teammates.
- **Overlay (ESP)**:
  - Displays enemy bounding boxes, snaplines, health numbers, nicknames, and a minimap.
  - Customizable colors, line thickness, and minimap size.
- **Bunnyhop**:
  - Automates bunny hopping for continuous jumping and speed maintenance.
- **NoFlash**:
  - Reduces or eliminates flashbang effects for uninterrupted visibility.
- **Automatic Offset Fetching**: Retrieves latest offsets from remote sources on startup.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
  - **Dashboard**: Shows bot status, offset updates, and version info.
  - **General Settings**: Toggle TriggerBot, Overlay, Bunnyhop, and NoFlash.
  - **Trigger Settings**: Configure trigger key, delays, and toggle mode.
  - **Overlay Settings**: Adjust ESP features and appearance.
  - **Logs Tab**: View real-time logs from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Requests\ItsJesewe\crashes\vw_logs.log`.
  - **FAQ Tab**: Answers to common questions about all features.
  - **Supporters Tab**: Lists contributors and supporters.
- **Dynamic Config Updates**: Applies `config.json` changes without restarting via `file_watcher.py`.
- **Update Checker**: Notifies of new versions via GitHub releases.
- **Logging**: Saves logs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Requests\ItsJesewe\crashes\vw_logs.log` and `vw_detailed_logs.log`.

   **PyMeow Module:**

**Note:** Requires Python >= 3.8 and < 3.12.5.

## Troubleshooting

- **Failed to Fetch Offsets**: Verify internet connection and source URL accessibility.
- **Offset Errors Post-Update**: Wait for updated offsets from [https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper).
- **Could Not Open `cs2.exe`**: Ensure the game is running with necessary permissions.
- **Overlay Not Displaying**: Check Overlay settings and game mode (windowed/borderless).
- **Bunnyhop Inconsistent**: Verify focus on game window and settings.
- **NoFlash Not Working**: Confirm offsets are updated and feature is enabled.
- **Unexpected Errors**: Review logs in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Requests\ItsJesewe\crashes\`.
- **Invalid Config Import**: Ensure `config.json` format is correct.
