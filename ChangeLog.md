### Summary

- **Configurable Bunnyhop:** Users can now set a custom jump key (e.g., mouse wheel, side buttons) and adjust the delay between jumps.
- **Adjustable NoFlash:** A new slider allows users to control the strength of flash suppression, from partial reduction to complete removal.
- **New GUI Tab:** The "Additional Settings" tab houses these new options.
- **Refactored Core Logic:** The Bunnyhop and NoFlash classes were updated to read these new settings from the configuration file.
