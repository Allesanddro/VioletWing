### Summary

- The `SKELETON_BONES` structure has been completely revised and expanded. The new structure provides a more accurate and detailed representation of the human skeleton, including distinct chains for the trunk, arms, and legs.
- A centralized theme system has been implemented to manage UI styling. Hardcoded values for fonts, colors, and widget styles in the GUI tabs have been replaced with constants imported from a new `gui/theme.py` module.
