# VioletWing Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of the VioletWing project, pledge to foster a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We are committed to creating a positive and respectful community that encourages collaboration and supports the development of the VioletWing tool for Counter-Strike 2.

## Our Standards

To maintain a positive community, we encourage behaviors such as:

- Demonstrating respect, empathy, and kindness toward others.
- Welcoming diverse perspectives and providing constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility for mistakes, apologizing when necessary, and learning from experiences.
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community over individual interests.
- Adhering to the technical and ethical guidelines outlined in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [README.md](README.md) documents.

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Use of offensive, sexualized, or derogatory language or imagery.
- Trolling, personal attacks, or inflammatory comments, including those targeting protected groups.
- Harassment, whether public or private, including unsolicited contact.
- Sharing others’ private information (e.g., email addresses, GitHub profiles) without explicit consent.
- Any behavior that violates the spirit of collaboration or the project’s goals, including actions that could be seen as cheating or unfair advantage in Counter-Strike 2.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project-related spaces, including the GitHub repository ([https://github.com/Jesewe/VioletWing](https://github.com/Jesewe/VioletWing)), issues, pull requests, discussions, and any public or private communication channels (e.g., email, Discord, or Boosty) related to VioletWing. It also applies when representing the project publicly, such as through contributions, social media posts, or events.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The VioletWing maintainers, led by the project owner (contact: jesewescience@outlook.com), are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. They will:

- Clarify standards of acceptable behavior.
- Take fair and appropriate action in response to violations.
- Remove, edit, or reject contributions (e.g., issues, pull requests, comments) that do not align with this Code of Conduct, providing clear reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement

Report any abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior to jesewescience@outlook.com. All reports will be reviewed promptly, fairly, and confidentially, respecting the privacy and security of the reporter. Maintainers may request additional details, such as screenshots or logs (e.g., from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Requests\ItsJesewe\crashes\vw_logs.log`), to investigate issues thoroughly.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Violations of this Code of Conduct will result in actions based on the following guidelines:

1. **Correction**  
   **Impact**: Minor issues, such as inappropriate language or failure to follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines (e.g., PEP 8, poor commit messages).  
   **Consequence**: A private written warning from maintainers, explaining the violation and how to correct it. A public apology may be requested if the issue occurred in a public space (e.g., GitHub issues).

2. **Warning**  
   **Impact**: A single incident or repeated minor violations, such as dismissive comments or failure to address review feedback in pull requests.  
   **Consequence**: A formal warning with a specified period (e.g., 30 days) during which the individual must avoid interaction with involved parties, including maintainers, in project spaces (e.g., GitHub, email). Continued violations may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

3. **Temporary Ban**  
   **Impact**: Serious or repeated violations, such as aggressive behavior, non-compliance with coding standards after feedback, or actions that disrupt project development (e.g., submitting malicious code).  
   **Consequence**: A temporary ban (e.g., 30–90 days) from all project interactions, including contributions, issues, and communication channels. Violating the ban may result in a permanent ban.

4. **Permanent Ban**  
   **Impact**: Severe or persistent violations, such as harassment, sharing private information, or actions that undermine the project’s integrity (e.g., attempting to bypass Counter-Strike 2’s anti-cheat systems in violation of the [README.md](README.md) disclaimer).  
   **Consequence**: A permanent ban from all project-related interactions and spaces.
