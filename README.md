# Overview
CS2 TriggerBot is an automated tool designed for Counter-Strike 2 that assists with precise aiming by automatically triggering a mouse click when an enemy is detected in the player's crosshairs.

## Features
- **Automatic Trigger**: Fires your weapon when an enemy is detected under your crosshair.
- **Configurable Trigger Key**: You can configure the trigger key through the `config.ini` file. By default, the side mouse button (MOUSE 5) is used.
- **Offsets and Client Data**: Fetches the latest offsets and client data automatically from remote sources.
- **Logging**: Detailed logs are saved in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Requests\ItsJesewe\crashes\tb_logs.log`.
- **Update Checker**: Automatically checks for updates from the GitHub repository.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jesewe/cs2-triggerbot.git
   cd cs2-triggerbot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Obfuscating and Compiling
1. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller pyarmor
   ```
2. **Generate Obfuscated Files**
   Navigate to the directory containing all scripts
   ```bash
   cd cs2-triggerbot
   ```
   and run:
   
   ```bash
   pyarmor gen --pack onefile main.py
   ```
4. **Rename the Output File**
   Rename the resulting ```dist/main.exe``` file and use it.

## Configuration
The `config.ini` file is automatically generated in the directory `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Requests\ItsJesewe\` on the first run. You can modify the `TriggerKey` in this file to change the key that activates the bot. The default key is set to `x2` (MOUSE 5).

Example `config.ini`:
```ini
[Settings]
TriggerKey = x2
ShotDelayMin = 0.01
ShotDelayMax = 0.03

[Logger]
LogLevel = INFO
```

## Usage
- Launch Counter-Strike 2.
- Run the TriggerBot using the command mentioned above.
- The bot will automatically start functioning when the game is active.

## Troubleshooting
- **Failed to Fetch Offsets:** Ensure you have an active internet connection and that the source URLs are accessible.
- **Could Not Open `cs2.exe`:** Make sure the game is running and that you have the necessary permissions.
- **Unexpected Errors:** Check the log file located in the log directory for more details.
